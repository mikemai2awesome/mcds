# JavaScript Production Build Fix

## Problem
Component JavaScript was not working in production build due to `DOMContentLoaded` event listeners not firing properly in the static build environment.

## Solution
Replaced `DOMContentLoaded` event listeners with `defer` attribute on script tags.

## Changes Made

### 1. Layout.astro
- Added `defer` attribute to global theme manager script
- Removed `DOMContentLoaded` wrapper
- Converted TypeScript syntax to vanilla JavaScript
- Initialize theme manager immediately (defer ensures DOM is ready)

### 2. Component Scripts Updated
All component scripts were updated with the same pattern:

**Before:**
```javascript
<script>
document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", () => {
  // Component initialization code
});
</script>
```

**After:**
```javascript
<script defer>
// Component initialization code runs immediately
// (defer ensures DOM is parsed before execution)
</script>
```

### 3. Files Modified
- `src/layouts/Layout.astro` - Global theme manager
- `src/components/Alert.astro` - Alert dismissal functionality
- `src/components/Accordion.astro` - Accordion expand/collapse
- `src/components/Dialog.astro` - Modal dialog controls
- `src/components/Tabs.astro` - Tab navigation
- `src/components/PopupNav.astro` - Popup navigation
- `src/components/Switch.astro` - Switch toggle functionality
- `src/components/Feed.astro` - Infinite scroll feed
- `src/components/Combobox.astro` - Combobox dropdown
- `src/pages/components/switch.astro` - Theme switch page

### 4. Benefits
- **Production Ready**: JavaScript now works in static builds
- **Better Performance**: Scripts load in parallel with HTML parsing
- **Execution Order**: Scripts execute in document order after DOM is ready
- **No Race Conditions**: Eliminates timing issues with DOM readiness

### 5. How `defer` Works
- Scripts with `defer` download in parallel with HTML parsing
- Execution is deferred until DOM parsing is complete
- Scripts execute in the order they appear in the document
- Equivalent to placing scripts at the end of `<body>` but with parallel downloading

### 6. Browser Support
The `defer` attribute is widely supported across all modern browsers and has been available since:
- Chrome: Yes (all versions)
- Firefox: Yes (all versions) 
- Safari: Yes (all versions)
- Edge: Yes (all versions)
- IE: 10+ (but project doesn't target IE)

## Testing
- Production build completes successfully
- All interactive components should now work in production environment
- No changes needed to development workflow
